                         <h3>What is Montreal College Shop?</h3>
                            We created Montreal College Shop to
                            offer you a huge assortment, more than just Best Buy products. Our Marketplace is like a virtual
                            shopping mall that allows top-rated sellers to offer their products through MontrealCollegeShop.ca*
                        <p>*Certain Best Buy policies including the Low Price Guarantee, Free
                                    Shipping and Returns policies do not apply to Marketplace.</p>

                            <p>Our top-rated North American sellers are handpicked by our team
                               and follow our timely shipping and return guidelines.</p>
                            <p>Committed to Customer Service</p>
                            <p>We make sure our sellers offer customer service and if you ever
                                aren’t getting the help you need – we’ll be there to step in at any point.
                            </p>
                            <p>Secure Payment Processing</p>
                            <p>Best Buy handles all Marketplace transactions directly so the
                                sellers never see your payment information.</p>
